This program is programmed with a default proccess which will output the first 10 words from the sample.txt file and if the file doen't have more than 10 words the program will output the whole file.
This program also could take in arguments which can change its source and append to the destination with specific number of words
e.g1 ./fileutil <dir_1> -a <dir_2> -n num
	this command will let the program to read the file from dir_1 with num of words and append to dir_2.
The sourcefile must be in the first argument if it is exist and the '-a destfile' and '-n numwords' can be in any orders.
e.g2 ./fileutil <dir_1> -a -n num <dir_2> 
	these will also get the same results as e.g1.
