Assignments 1 and 2 are done in a group of 3. Assignment 3 is individual work.

Assignment 1 requires us to come up with 2 algorithms for identifying and cropping car plates in an image. 

Assignment 2 requires us to implement a character recognition neural network and character segmentation algorithm to segregate and recognize characters in images of car plates.

Assignment 3 requires us to train and improve the neural network derived from Assignment 2 and perform an analysis of our results. All findings are included in a written report.
