Assignment 1 is an individual project which requires me to research a topic from several selections. I selected DeepFake as my research topic and produce a report which is discussing the ethical issues related to Deepfake.

Assignment 2 is a group work of 6 people. We are required to come up with a solution that resolves a certain ethical issue pertaining to generative AI. The project's deliverables are in the form of a report and a presentation.

Assignment 3 is yet another individual project which requires me to write a reflective journal regarding the experiences of the previous two assignments.
