All assignments are individual projects where we have to implement taught algorithms and make slight changes to adhere to 
the requirements of the question.

Assignment 1 is related to Gusfield's Z-algorithm and Boyer-Moore's algorithm for linear string pattern matching.

Assignment 2 is related to Ukkonen's algorithm for linear suffix tree construction, and data compression algorithms including
the Burrows-Wheeler-Transform, Elias Omega Encoding, and Huffman Encoding. 

Assignment 3 is related to Miller-Rabin's Primality Testing and the Simplex Method for Linear Programming.
