Assignment 1 is about translating Python code into machine code. In this assignment, the machine code assigned by Monash University is MIPS.
Additionally, we are required to comment the time complexities of the functions within Tasks 4 and 5.

Assignment 2 is about implementing Object-Oriented Programming in Python. We are to write code implementing the logic of a turn-based Pokemon battle game.

Assignment 3 is also about implementing Object-Orienting Programming. We are to write code implementing yet another game, Potion Seller. This involves the use of ADTs to implement the logic of buying, selling, and storing potions.
